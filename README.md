Homework Calendar

This project is an event day planner.
With this project, it outlines the 9am-5pm time slots to fill in time slots for the day by the hour. 
The user is able to fill the input with text or meetings and saving it to local storage.
After the current day and time is passed, it should disable the input field not allowing user input.
If user needs to clear input, simply delete the text and save to update. 
Input items are still available even after refreshing the browser unless cleared and saved.
